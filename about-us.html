            The history of Liverpool can be traced back to 1190 when the place 
            was known as 'Liuerpul', possibly meaning a pool or creek with muddy water,
             though other origins of the name have been suggested. The borough was 
             founded by royal charter in 1207 by King John, was made up of only seven 
             streets in the shape of the letter 'H' but Liverpool remained a small
              settlement until its trade with Ireland and coastal parts of England 
              and Wales was overtaken by trade with Africa and the West Indies, which 
              included the slave trade. The world's first wet dock was opened in 1715 
              and Liverpool's expansion to become a major city continued over the next 
              two centuries. By the start of the nineteenth century, a large volume of 
              trade was passing through Liverpool. In 1830, the Liverpool and Manchester 
              Railway was opened. The population grew rapidly, especially with Irish migrants; 
              by 1851, one quarter of the city's population was Irish-born. As growth continued, 
              the city became known as "the second city of the Empire", and was also called 
              "the New York of Europe". During the Second World War, the city was the centre 
              for planning the crucial Battle of the Atlantic, and suffered a blitz second only
              to London's. From the mid-twentieth century, Liverpool's docks and 
              traditional manufacturing industries went into sharp decline, 
              with the advent of containerisation making the city's docks obsolete. 
              The unemployment rate in Liverpool rose to one of the highest in the UK. 
              Over the same period, starting in the early 1960s, the city became 
              internationally renowned for its culture, particularly as the centre of 
              the "Merseybeat" sound which became synonymous with The Beatles. 
              In recent years, Liverpool's economy has recovered, partly due to tourism 
              as well as substantial investment in regeneration schemes. The city was the 
              European Capital of Culture for 2008.
